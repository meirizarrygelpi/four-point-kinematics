\chapter{Slow Compton Kinematics}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this chapter I will consider the kinematics of a 2-to-2 Compton scattering process. This means that you have a massive elastic pair, and a massless elastic pair. Thus, this is an elastic process. For example,
\begin{equation}
	e^{-}(p_{1}) + \gamma(p_{2}) \longrightarrow e^{-}(p_{3}) + \gamma(p_{4}).
\end{equation}
Energy-momentum conservation leads to the constraint
\begin{equation}
	p_{1} + p_{2} = p_{3} + p_{4}.
\end{equation}
This constraint means that only three out of the four external energy-momentum vectors are linearly independent. Due to this process being elastic, there are now two elasticity constraints:
\begin{equation}
	\abs{p_{1}}^{2} = \abs{p_{3}}^{2}, \qquad \abs{p_{2}}^{2} = \abs{p_{4}}^{2} = 0.
\end{equation}

\section{Simplicial Invariants}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A tetrahedron is a 3-simplex. As such, it contains four vertices (0-simplex), six edges (1-simplex), four triangular faces (2-simplex), and one tetrahedron (3-simplex). The $n$-volume of an $n$-simplex is found by evaluating an $(n+1)$-point Cayley-Menger determinant. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{1-Simplex Invariants}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Given two dual spacetime positions, the 2-point Cayley-Menger determinant is given by:
\begin{equation}
	C_{ij} = -\frac{1}{2} \det{
	\begin{pmatrix}
	0 & \abs{d_{ij}}^{2} & 1 \\
	\abs{d_{ij}}^{2} & 0 & 1 \\
	1 & 1 & 0
	\end{pmatrix}
	}.
\end{equation}
Since a tetrahedron has six edges, there are six possible 1-simplex invariants. These invariants will be either squared masses or Mandelstam invariants. For the \red{red} tetrahedron you have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	C_{\red{12}} = m^{2}, \qquad C_{\red{13}} &= s, \qquad C_{\red{14}} = m^{2}, \\
	C_{\red{23}} = m^{2}, \qquad C_{\red{24}} &= t, \qquad C_{\red{34}} = m^{2}. \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Similarly, for the \blue{blue} tetrahedron you have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	C_{\blue{12}} = m^{2}, \qquad C_{\blue{13}} &= t, \qquad C_{\blue{14}} = m^{2}, \\
	C_{\blue{23}} = m^{2}, \qquad C_{\blue{24}} &= u, \qquad C_{\blue{34}} = m^{2}. \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Finally, for the \green{green} tetrahedron you have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	C_{\green{12}} = m^{2}, \qquad C_{\green{13}} &= u, \qquad C_{\green{14}} = m^{2}, \\
	C_{\green{23}} = m^{2}, \qquad C_{\green{24}} &= s, \qquad C_{\green{34}} = m^{2}. \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{2-Simplex Invariants}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Given three dual spacetime positions, the 3-point Cayley-Menger determinant is given by:
\begin{equation}
	C_{ijk} = \det{
	\begin{pmatrix}
	0 & \abs{d_{ij}}^{2} & \abs{d_{ik}}^{2} & 1 \\
	\abs{d_{ij}}^{2} & 0 & \abs{d_{jk}}^{2} & 1 \\
	\abs{d_{ik}}^{2} & \abs{d_{jk}}^{2} & 0 & 1 \\
	1 & 1 & 1 & 0
	\end{pmatrix}
	}.
\end{equation}
Since a tetrahedron has four triangular faces, there are four possible 2-simplex invariants. Each of these invariants has the form
\begin{equation}
	\Lambda_{IJ}(x) = \kallen{x}{m_{I}}{m_{J}},
\end{equation}
where $x$ is a Mandelstam invariant. This function is also known as the K\"{a}ll\'{e}n function. For the \red{red} tetrahedron you have
\begin{equation}
	C_{\red{123}} = C_{\red{134}} = \left(s - m^{2} \right)^{2}, \qquad C_{\red{124}} = C_{\red{234}} = \left(t - m^{2} \right)^{2}.
\end{equation}
Similarly, for the \blue{blue} tetrahedron you have
\begin{equation}
	C_{\blue{123}} = C_{\blue{134}} = \left(t - m^{2} \right)^{2}, \qquad C_{\blue{124}} = C_{\blue{234}} = \left(u - m^{2} \right)^{2}.
\end{equation}
Finally, for the \green{green} tetrahedron you have
\begin{equation}
	C_{\green{123}} = C_{\green{134}} = \left(u - m^{2} \right)^{2}, \qquad C_{\green{124}} = C_{\green{234}} = \left(s - m^{2} \right)^{2}.
\end{equation}
Note that all 2-simplex invariants are strictly positive by definition.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{3-Simplex Invariants}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Given four dual spacetime positions, the 4-point Cayley-Menger determinant is given by:
\begin{equation}
	C_{ijkl} = -\frac{1}{2} \det{
	\begin{pmatrix}
	0 & \abs{d_{ij}}^{2} & \abs{d_{ik}}^{2} & \abs{d_{il}}^{2} & 1 \\
	\abs{d_{ij}}^{2} & 0 & \abs{d_{jk}}^{2} & \abs{d_{jl}}^{2} & 1 \\
	\abs{d_{ik}}^{2} & \abs{d_{jk}}^{2} & 0 & \abs{d_{kl}}^{2} & 1 \\
	\abs{d_{il}}^{2} & \abs{d_{jl}}^{2} & \abs{d_{kl}}^{2} & 0 & 1 \\
	1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0
	\end{pmatrix}
	}.
\end{equation}
A tetrahedron has only one possible 3-simplex invariant. Indeed,
\begin{equation}
	C_{\red{1234}} = C_{\blue{1234}} = C_{\green{1234}} = t \left(s u - m^{4} \right).
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Dual Conformal Invariants}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Each of the 1-simplex invariants has the form $\abs{d_{i} - d_{j}}^{2}$. This is not only Lorentz invariant, but dual Poincar\'{e} invariant. You can study dual conformal invariants by constructing a dual conformal ratio with a quartet of dual spacetime coordinates:
\begin{equation}
	\crat{i}{j}{k}{l} \equiv \frac{\abs{d_{ik}}^{2} \abs{d_{jl}}^{2}}{\abs{d_{il}}^{2} \abs{d_{jk}}^{2}}.
\end{equation}
In four-point scattering there is a unique quartet of dual spacetime coordinates. However, there are six inequivalent permutations of these coordinates, and thus, six possible values for the dual conformal ratio.

For the \red{red} tetrahedron, you have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{2}}{\red{3}}{\red{4}} = \frac{s t}{m^{4}}, \qquad
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{3}}{\red{4}}{\red{2}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{4}}{\red{2}}{\red{3}} = \frac{m^{4}}{s t}, \\
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{2}}{\red{4}}{\red{3}} = \frac{m^{4}}{s t}, \qquad
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{3}}{\red{2}}{\red{4}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{4}}{\red{3}}{\red{2}} = \frac{s t}{m^{4}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Similarly, for the \blue{blue} tetrahedron, you have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{2}}{\blue{3}}{\blue{4}} = \frac{t u}{m^{4}}, \qquad
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{3}}{\blue{4}}{\blue{2}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{4}}{\blue{2}}{\blue{3}} = \frac{m^{4}}{t u}, \\
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{2}}{\blue{4}}{\blue{3}} = \frac{m^{4}}{t u}, \qquad
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{3}}{\blue{2}}{\blue{4}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{4}}{\blue{3}}{\blue{2}} = \frac{t u}{m^{4}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Finally, for the \green{green} tetrahedron, you have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{2}}{\green{3}}{\green{4}} = \frac{s u}{m^{4}}, \qquad
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{3}}{\green{4}}{\green{2}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{4}}{\green{2}}{\green{3}} = \frac{m^{4}}{s u}, \\
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{2}}{\green{4}}{\green{3}} = \frac{m^{4}}{s u}, \qquad
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{3}}{\green{2}}{\green{4}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{4}}{\green{3}}{\green{2}} = \frac{s u}{m^{4}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Note that
\begin{equation}
	\crat{1}{2}{3}{4} \crat{1}{3}{4}{2} \crat{1}{4}{2}{3} = 1,
\end{equation}
which is analogous to the constraint satisfied by the three Mandelstam invariants.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Center-of-Momentum Frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In the center-of-momentum frame you write the energy-momentum vectors as
\begin{equation}
	p_{1} = \begin{pmatrix} E_{1} & \mathbf{p}_{1} \end{pmatrix}, \qquad p_{2} = \begin{pmatrix} E_{2} & -\mathbf{p}_{1} \end{pmatrix}, \qquad p_{3} = \begin{pmatrix} E_{3} & \mathbf{p}_{3} \end{pmatrix}, \qquad p_{4} = \begin{pmatrix} E_{4} & -\mathbf{p}_{3} \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
One of the first things to notice is that
\begin{equation}
	s = (E_{1} + E_{2})^{2} = (E_{3} + E_{4})^{2}.
\end{equation}
Thus, $s$ can be interpreted as the total energy in the center-of-momentum frame. It also follows that $s$ must be positive.

From the on-shell constraints, it follows that
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	E_{1} = \sqrt{m^{2} + \abs{\mathbf{p}_{1}}^{2}}, &\qquad E_{2} = \sqrt{m^{2} + \abs{\mathbf{p}_{1}}^{2}}, \\
	E_{3} = \sqrt{m^{2} + \abs{\mathbf{p}_{3}}^{2}}, &\qquad E_{4} = \sqrt{m^{2} + \abs{\mathbf{p}_{3}}^{2}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
Using the relations
\begin{equation}
	E_{2} = \sqrt{s} - E_{1}, \qquad E_{4} = \sqrt{s} - E_{3},
\end{equation}
you find that
\begin{equation}
	\abs{\mathbf{p}_{1}} = \abs{\mathbf{p}_{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{s - 4m^{2}}}{2}.
\end{equation}
Thus,
\begin{equation}
	E_{1} = E_{2} = E_{3} = E_{4} = \frac{\sqrt{s}}{2}.
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Speed and Rapidity}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A quantum with mass $m$, spatial momentum $\mathbf{p}$, and energy $E$ has a speed $\abs{\mathbf{v}}$ given by
\begin{equation}
	\abs{\mathbf{v}} = \frac{\sqrt{E^{2} - m^{2}}}{E^{2}} = \frac{\abs{\mathbf{p}}}{\sqrt{m^{2} + \abs{\mathbf{p}}^{2}}} = \frac{\abs{\mathbf{p}}}{E}.
\end{equation}
If the quantum is physical, then $E \geq m$, or equivalently, $\abs{\mathbf{p}} < E$. Both of these conditions lead to a bound on speed:
\begin{equation}
	0 \leq \abs{\mathbf{v}} < 1.
\end{equation}
In contrast with energy, mass, and spatial momentum, speed and velocity are dimensionless. However, energy and spatial momentum are conserved, but velocity is not. The speed of each external quantum is
\begin{equation}
	\abs{\mathbf{v}_{1}} = \abs{\mathbf{v}_{2}} = \abs{\mathbf{v}_{3}} = \abs{\mathbf{v}_{4}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{4 m^{2}}{s}}.
\end{equation}
Given the speed of a quantum, you can find its rapidity $\eta$ via
\begin{equation}
	\eta = \operatorname{arctanh}{\abs{\mathbf{v}}} = \frac{1}{2} \log{\left( \frac{1 + \abs{\mathbf{v}}}{1 - \abs{\mathbf{v}}} \right)}.
\end{equation}
Since the speed of a physical quantum is bounded, the rapidity of a physical quantum is bounded from below:
\begin{equation}
	0 \leq \eta < \infty.
\end{equation}
The rapidity of each external quantum is
\begin{equation}
	\eta_{1} = \eta_{2} = \eta_{3} = \eta_{4} = \frac{1}{2} \log{\left[\frac{\sqrt{s} + \sqrt{s - 4 m^{2}}}{\sqrt{s} - \sqrt{s - 4 m^{2}}}\right]}.
\end{equation}
The sum of the incoming rapidites is equal to the sum of the outgoing rapidities:
\begin{equation}
	\eta_{1} + \eta_{2} = \eta_{3} + \eta_{4} = \log{\left[\frac{\sqrt{s} + \sqrt{s - 4 m^{2}}}{\sqrt{s} - \sqrt{s - 4 m^{2}}}\right]}.
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Physical Scattering Region}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
...
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Fixed-Speed Scattering}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The speed of each external quantum can be written as a function of one dimensionless ratio,
\begin{equation}
	\frac{s}{m^{2}}.
\end{equation}
Fixed-speed scattering corresponds to the kinematic regime where we keep this ratio fixed:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{s}{m^{2}} \text{ fixed}.
\end{equation}
This regime is appropriate for either large $s$ and large mass, or small $s$ and small mass. Note that fixed-speed is equivalent to fixed-rapidity. By itself, this regime is not very helpful, but when combined with other limits it leads to important approximations.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Small-Speed Scattering}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Small speeds occur when $s$ is close to the threshold value $4 m^{2}$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Large-Speed Scattering}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Large-speed scattering involves the regime
\begin{equation}
	\frac{s}{m^{2}} \rightarrow \infty.
\end{equation}
That is, $\sqrt{s}$ is very large compared to the mass.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Regge Scattering}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Regge scattering is the regime of fixed-speed and large (unphysical) $z_{13}$. This corresponds to
\begin{equation}
	\frac{t}{s} \rightarrow \infty, \qquad \frac{s}{m^{2}} \text{ fixed}.
\end{equation}
As a corollary, you have
\begin{equation}
	u = 4m^{2} - s - t \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \frac{u}{s} \rightarrow -\infty.
\end{equation}
In this regime all dual conformal invariants become trivial:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{2}}{\red{3}}{\red{4}} \rightarrow \infty, \qquad
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{3}}{\red{4}}{\red{2}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{4}}{\red{2}}{\red{3}} \rightarrow 0, \\
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{2}}{\red{4}}{\red{3}} \rightarrow 0, \qquad
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{3}}{\red{2}}{\red{4}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{4}}{\red{3}}{\red{2}} \rightarrow \infty.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{2}}{\blue{3}}{\blue{4}} \rightarrow -\infty, \qquad
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{3}}{\blue{4}}{\blue{2}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{4}}{\blue{2}}{\blue{3}} \rightarrow 0, \\
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{2}}{\blue{4}}{\blue{3}} \rightarrow 0, \qquad
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{3}}{\blue{2}}{\blue{4}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{4}}{\blue{3}}{\blue{2}} \rightarrow -\infty.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{2}}{\green{3}}{\green{4}} \rightarrow -\infty, \qquad
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{3}}{\green{4}}{\green{2}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{4}}{\green{2}}{\green{3}} \rightarrow 0, \\
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{2}}{\green{4}}{\green{3}} \rightarrow 0, \qquad
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{3}}{\green{2}}{\green{4}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{4}}{\green{3}}{\green{2}} \rightarrow -\infty.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Forward Scattering}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Forward scattering is the regime of fixed-speed and small (physical) scattering angles (i.e. $z_{13} \rightarrow 1$). This can be stated as
\begin{equation}
	\frac{t}{s} \rightarrow 0, \qquad \frac{s}{m^{2}} \text{ fixed}.
\end{equation}
As a corollary, you have
\begin{equation}
	u = 4m^{2} - s - t \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \frac{u}{s} \text{ fixed}.
\end{equation}
Unlike the case of Regge scattering, in the forward regime only some of the dual conformal invariants are trivial:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{2}}{\red{3}}{\red{4}} \rightarrow 0, \qquad
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{3}}{\red{4}}{\red{2}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{4}}{\red{2}}{\red{3}} \rightarrow \infty, \\
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{2}}{\red{4}}{\red{3}} \rightarrow \infty, \qquad
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{3}}{\red{2}}{\red{4}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{4}}{\red{3}}{\red{2}} \rightarrow 0.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{2}}{\blue{3}}{\blue{4}} \rightarrow 0, \qquad
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{3}}{\blue{4}}{\blue{2}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{4}}{\blue{2}}{\blue{3}} \rightarrow \infty, \\
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{2}}{\blue{4}}{\blue{3}} \rightarrow \infty, \qquad
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{3}}{\blue{2}}{\blue{4}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{4}}{\blue{3}}{\blue{2}} \rightarrow 0.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The rest of the dual conformal invariants are fixed and nontrivial:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{2}}{\green{3}}{\green{4}} = \frac{s u}{m^{4}}, \qquad
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{3}}{\green{4}}{\green{2}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{4}}{\green{2}}{\green{3}} = \frac{m^{4}}{s u}, \\
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{2}}{\green{4}}{\green{3}} = \frac{m^{4}}{s u}, \qquad
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{3}}{\green{2}}{\green{4}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{4}}{\green{3}}{\green{2}} = \frac{s u}{m^{4}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Backward Scattering}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Backward scattering is the regime of fixed-speed and large (physical) scattering angles (i.e. $z_{13} \rightarrow -1$). This can be stated as
\begin{equation}
	\frac{u}{s} \rightarrow 0, \qquad \frac{s}{m^{2}} \text{ fixed}.
\end{equation}
As a corollary, you have
\begin{equation}
	t = 4m^{2} - s - u \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \frac{t}{s} \text{ fixed}.
\end{equation}
Similarly to the forward scattering regime, some of the dual conformal invariants are trivial:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{2}}{\blue{3}}{\blue{4}} \rightarrow 0, \qquad
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{3}}{\blue{4}}{\blue{2}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{4}}{\blue{2}}{\blue{3}} \rightarrow \infty, \\
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{2}}{\blue{4}}{\blue{3}} \rightarrow \infty, \qquad
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{3}}{\blue{2}}{\blue{4}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{4}}{\blue{3}}{\blue{2}} \rightarrow 0.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{2}}{\green{3}}{\green{4}} \rightarrow 0, \qquad
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{3}}{\green{4}}{\green{2}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{4}}{\green{2}}{\green{3}} \rightarrow \infty, \\
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{2}}{\green{4}}{\green{3}} \rightarrow \infty, \qquad
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{3}}{\green{2}}{\green{4}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{4}}{\green{3}}{\green{2}} \rightarrow 0.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
The rest of the dual conformal invariants are fixed and nontrivial:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{2}}{\red{3}}{\red{4}} = \frac{s t}{m^{4}}, \qquad
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{3}}{\red{4}}{\red{2}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{4}}{\red{2}}{\red{3}} = \frac{m^{4}}{s t}, \\
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{2}}{\red{4}}{\red{3}} = \frac{m^{4}}{s t}, \qquad
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{3}}{\red{2}}{\red{4}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{4}}{\red{3}}{\red{2}} = \frac{s t}{m^{4}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Fixed-Angle Scattering}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Fixed-angle scattering is the regime of large-speed and (physical) fixed-angle. This can be stated as
\begin{equation}
	\frac{t}{s} \text{ fixed}, \qquad \frac{s}{m^{2}} \rightarrow \infty.
\end{equation}
As a corollary, you have
\begin{equation}
	u = 4m^{2} - s - t \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \frac{u}{s} \text{ fixed}.
\end{equation}
In this regime all dual conformal invariants become trivial:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{2}}{\red{3}}{\red{4}} \rightarrow -\infty, \qquad
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{3}}{\red{4}}{\red{2}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{4}}{\red{2}}{\red{3}} \rightarrow 0, \\
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{2}}{\red{4}}{\red{3}} \rightarrow 0, \qquad
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{3}}{\red{2}}{\red{4}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\red{1}}{\red{4}}{\red{3}}{\red{2}} \rightarrow -\infty.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{2}}{\blue{3}}{\blue{4}} \rightarrow \infty, \qquad
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{3}}{\blue{4}}{\blue{2}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{4}}{\blue{2}}{\blue{3}} \rightarrow 0, \\
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{2}}{\blue{4}}{\blue{3}} \rightarrow 0, \qquad
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{3}}{\blue{2}}{\blue{4}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\blue{1}}{\blue{4}}{\blue{3}}{\blue{2}} \rightarrow \infty.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{2}}{\green{3}}{\green{4}} \rightarrow -\infty, \qquad
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{3}}{\green{4}}{\green{2}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{4}}{\green{2}}{\green{3}} \rightarrow 0, \\
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{2}}{\green{4}}{\green{3}} \rightarrow 0, \qquad
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{3}}{\green{2}}{\green{4}} &= 1, \qquad
	\crat{\green{1}}{\green{4}}{\green{3}}{\green{2}} \rightarrow -\infty.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
From the point of view of dual conformal invariants, Regge scattering and fixed-angle scattering are very similar.
